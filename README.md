# About the project
This project is the result of a personal need: to manage my web bookmarks/favorites from any browser on any computer.
Although practically all web browsers allow the import and synchronization of bookmarks, importing favorite links from a browser on a computer to a different browser on a different computer is not a direct process.
[Linkcase.org](https://linkcase.org) is an easy way to manage your bookmarks no matter where are you and which terminal are you working on.
